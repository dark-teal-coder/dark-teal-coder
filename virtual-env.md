# How to Install a Virtual Environment Using Venv

Virtualenv is a tool to set up your Python environments. Since Python 3.3, a subset of it has been integrated into the standard library under the venv module. You can install venv to your host Python by running this command in your terminal:

```powershell
pip install virtualenv
```

To use venv in your project, in your terminal, create a new project folder, cd to the project folder in your terminal, and run the following command:

```powershell
python -m venv <virtual-environment-name>
```
