## Python `.py` & `.ipynb`
### Description
I've officially taken 2 Python courses before - one at undergraduate level and another at graduate level. I've also written some real-world applications in Python in one of my full-time jobs.  
- [x] IS2240 Python Programming for Business [A-]
- [x] CSCI E-7 Introduction to Python [A-]
### Syntax and Concepts
- basic syntax, e.g., variables, data types, string operations, arithmetic operators, assignment operators, comparison operators, logical operators, conditions, loops, functions, etc. 
- basic object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, e.g., class/object, attributes, class methods, inner class, constructors, inheritance, etc.
- file handling
- exception handling
- recursion 
- lambda
### Applications
- regular expression (RegEx) with `re`
- data analysis with `pandas` 
- data visualization with `matplotlib` 
- web scrapping with `requests` & `BeautifulSoup`

## Java `.java` & `.class`
### Description
I've taken the following course which used Java in my undergraduate studies. Lectures 11 to 13 were on Formal Language and the others focused mainly on Java syntax and concepts. This cousre also touched on basic sorting algorithms. 
- [x] LT3233 Computational Linguistics [A]
### Syntax and Concepts

## HTML, CSS & JavaScript `.html` & `.css` & `.js`
### Description
I've taken the following undergraduate course that covers basic HTML and CSS syntax to create simple websites and JavaScript syntax to add interactivity to the websites many years ago. 
- [x] LT3210 Electronic Publishing [A]
### Syntax and Concepts
- ...

## R `.rmd`
### Description
I'm taking a R programming course at graduate level. There are one midterm and one final that together contribute to 80% of the final course grade.

# Git Matters

## Basic Steps to Get a Remote Repository on GitHub to Your Local Machine
Steps: 
1. Go to GitHub. 
2. Click into the remote repository that you want to get. 
3. Click the [Code] button. 
4. Select the [HTTPS] tab. 
5. Copy the HTTPS URL. 
6. Open a command-line interface (CLI). 
7. Change the directory to the one you want to put the entire remote repository in using the `cd` command followed by the directory path[^1]. 
8. Type `git clone` followed by the HTTPS URL you copied in Step 5[^2]. 
9. Press [ENTER]. 
[^1]: 
    A folder with the same name and structure as the remote repository will appear in the exact directory in which the `git clone` command is used on your local machine. 
[^2]: 
    It is unnecessary to use `git init` before `git clone`. The cloned respository already has `.git` folder inside it. 

## Basic Steps to Create a New Repository
Steps: 
1. Go to your profile page on GitHub. 
2. Select the [Repositories] tab. 
3. Click the [New] button. 
4. Give a name to your new repository under "Repository name". 
5. Choose whether you want the repository to be [Public] or [Private]. 
6. Click the [Create repository] button[^3]. 
7. Open a command-line interface (CLI). 
8. Navigate to the desired directory on your local machine using the `cd` command followed by the directory path[^4]. 
9. Create a new folder using the same name of the remote repository just created using the `mkdir` command followed by the folder name. 
10. Use the command `cd` followed by the folder name to go inside the newly created folder. 
12. Type `git init` to let Git start tracking the folder. 
13. Use `git add .` to add all the files inside the folder to the staging area[^5]. 
14. Use `git commit -m "commit message"` to keep track of your progress and changes of the project[^6]. 
15. Use `git branch -M main` to create a new branch in the repository and force-rename it "main"[^7]. 
16. Click into the remote repository.
17. Click the [Code] button. 
18. Select the [HTTPS] tab. 
19. Copy the HTTPS URL. 
20. Use the command `git remote add origin` followed by the HTTPS URL to inform Git which remote repository you want to work with the current local repository[^8]. 
21. Use `git push -u origin main` to push the code from your local to the remote repository at the HTTPS URL stored in `origin`[^9]. 

[^3]: 
  You can also choose whether you want to add `README.md`, `.gitignore` and `LICENSE` filles to the newly created repository before clicking the [Create repository] button. 
[^4]: 
  You can also use "File Explorer" on Windows to do this. 
[^5]: 
  This will direct Git to save a snapshot of the current project state into the commit history. 
[^6]: 
  This will capture a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. 
[^7]
  If you created the remote repository without adding `README.md`, `.gitignore` and `LICENSE` filles, the default branch will be `master`. This command will change it to `main`. 
[^8]:
  `origin` is a reference (name) pointing to the HTTPS URL of the remote repository. 
[^9]: 
  The `-u` options is a shorthand for `--set-upstream` which maps a local branch to a remote barnch.
