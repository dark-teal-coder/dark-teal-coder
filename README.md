# IDE Matters 

> IDE = Integrated Development Environment

These are IDEs I know how to use, in the order I learned to use them. 

- The very first "IDE" I used when I started learning to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript: 
![Notepad++ badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Notepad++-90E59A.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=notepad%2B%2B&logoColor=black)
- First learned to run Java in an instructor-led class outside university: 
![Eclipse badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Eclipse-2C2255?style=for-the-badge&logo=eclipse&logoColor=white)
- First learned to use it in a Python class after learning Java in my undergraduate: ![PyCharm badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyCharm-000000.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=PyCharm&logoColor=FCF84A)
- First time coming across Jupyter Notebook was when my colleague told me about it: ![Jupyter Notebook badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-F37626.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=Jupyter&logoColor=white)
- Then, later towards the end of my 1st IT job, I switched from Notepad++ to VS Code: ![VS Code badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual_Studio_Code-0078D4?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual%20studio%20code&logoColor=white)
- Well, I found out about this Colab integration with GitHub from a freeCodeCamp course, which can bypass the problem of code cells in Jupyter notebooks not able to run on GitHub: 
![Google Colab badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Colab-F9AB00?style=for-the-badge&logo=googlecolab&color=525252)

# CLI Matters 

> CLI = Command Line Interface

These are CLIs I know how to use, in the order I learned to use them. 

1. Command Prompt ![CMD badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Command%20Prompt-000000?style=flat-square&logo=windows%20terminal&logoColor=white)
